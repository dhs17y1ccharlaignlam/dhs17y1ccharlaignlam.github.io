  <h2>Review</h2>
<p>Set in modern-day Paris, the series focuses on teenagers Marinette Dupain-Cheng and
Adrien Agreste. When evil arises, Marinette transforms into her secret superhero 
persona Ladybug, while Adrien transforms into his superhero persona Cat Noir, 
using powerful objects known as the Miraculous. Oblivious to each other's true 
identities, the two work together to protect Paris from the mysterious villain Hawk 
Moth, who covets and attempts to steal their powers by using his akuma, butterflies 
infused with black energy, to transform everyday citizens into supervillains.</p>
